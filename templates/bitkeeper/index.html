        </ul>
        <h2>N/A editor</h2>
        When the base data was initially imported into Bitkeeper, missing values were given the value "N/A". You can edit each of these missing values below. <P>
        <br>
        <br>
        If there really is no value that goes in that field (like the "mayor" field of a municipality that has no mayor), delete "N/A" from that field and save the table row. (Doing this sets the value of that field to null/None).
